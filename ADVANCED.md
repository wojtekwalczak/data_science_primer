## Mathematics

* \[[book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf)\] **_Convex Optimization_ by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberge**.


## Machine learning

* \[[book](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)\] **_The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction_ by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman** - a compendium of statistical learning techniques. Nice as a reference or an overview, but not necessarily as a source for learning. So many approaches and techniques are described in this book, that out of necessity, their description is very general, very condensed and very mathematical.
